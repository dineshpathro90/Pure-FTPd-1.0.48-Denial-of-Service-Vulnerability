Introduction:
In the realm of cybersecurity, understanding vulnerabilities within software is paramount to ensuring the safety and integrity of systems. In this blog post, we'll delve into a particular exploit targeting Pure-FTPd 1.0.48, a popular FTP server software. We'll explore how a remote Denial of Service (DoS) attack can be executed using a Python script, and discuss mitigation strategies to safeguard against such exploits.
Pure-FTPd Vulnerability:
Pure-FTPd, a robust and widely-used FTP server, unfortunately harbors a vulnerability in version 1.0.48, which can be exploited to disrupt its normal operations. The vulnerability lies in its handling of incoming connections, where an attacker can overwhelm the server with a barrage of connection requests, subsequently denying legitimate users access to the service.
Exploit Overview:
The exploit script, crafted by security researcher xynmaps, leverages this vulnerability to orchestrate a DoS attack against Pure-FTPd servers. By repeatedly establishing new connections to the target server, the attacker can saturate its resources, rendering it unresponsive to genuine connection attempts.
Understanding the Script:
The Python script provided automates the process of launching a DoS attack against a Pure-FTPd server. Let's break down its functionality:
Initialization
Connection Testing
Attack Execution
Attack Monitoring

Usage Instructions:
Using the provided script to execute the Pure-FTPd DoS attack is straightforward:
Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Save the script to a local file, e.g., pureftpd_dos.py.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Execute the script with the following command:

Replace <TARGET_IP> with the IP address of the Pure-FTPd server, <PORT> with the desired port number (optional), and <MAX_CONNECTIONS> with the maximum number of concurrent connections to establish (optional).

python pureftpd_dos.py <TARGET_IP> <PORT> <MAX_CONNECTIONS>

Sit back and monitor the attack progress. The script will automatically terminate after 15 minutes and restart if desired.
Conclusion:
Pure-FTPd's vulnerability to remote DoS attacks underscores the importance of proactive security measures in safeguarding network infrastructure. By understanding the intricacies of such exploits and adopting robust defense mechanisms, organizations can fortify their systems against malicious actors. It is imperative for system administrators to promptly apply software patches and implement intrusion detection systems to mitigate the risk posed by vulnerabilities like the one discussed herein.
