**Title: Pure-FTPd Denial of Service Exploit**

**Introduction:**
In the realm of cybersecurity, it's crucial to understand potential vulnerabilities within various systems and software. One such vulnerability was discovered in Pure-FTPd version 1.0.48, allowing for a remote Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This exploit, crafted by XYN/Dump/NSKB3, enables an attacker to flood the target server with connection requests, ultimately rendering it unresponsive to legitimate users.

**Overview:**
This Python script automates the process of launching a DoS attack on a Pure-FTPd server. By repeatedly establishing new connections to the target server, the script overwhelms it, causing denial of service to legitimate users trying to access the FTP service.

**Features:**
- Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- Customizable parameters including target IP address, port, and maximum number of connections.
- Utilizes multithreading for efficient resource utilization during the attack.
- Includes a timer to automatically restart the attack after a specified duration, ensuring prolonged disruption.

**How to Use:**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository containing the exploit script from GitHub to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   https://github.com/dineshpathro90/Pure-FTPd-1.0.48-Denial-of-Service-Vulnerability.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Directory:**
   Move into the directory containing the exploit script:
   ```
   cd repository
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, no external dependencies are required for this script.

4. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script with the desired parameters:
   ```
   python exploit.py <TARGET_IP> <PORT> <MAX_CONNECTIONS>
   ```
   - `<TARGET_IP>`: The IP address of the target Pure-FTPd server.
   - `<PORT>` (optional, default: 21): The port number of the FTP service.
   - `<MAX_CONNECTIONS>` (optional, default: 50): The maximum number of simultaneous connections to establish during the attack.

5. **Monitor the Attack:**
   Once the script is running, it will display status messages indicating the progress of the attack. You can monitor the effects of the DoS attack on the target server.

6. **Automate Restart (Optional):**
   To automate the restart of the attack after a specified duration (e.g., 15 minutes), modify the `timer()` function within the script:
   ```python
   start < time.time() + 900
   ```
   Change `900` to the desired duration in seconds.

**Conclusion:**
This Pure-FTPd Denial of Service exploit script provides security professionals with a tool to assess the vulnerability of FTP servers running Pure-FTPd version 1.0.48. However, it's essential to use this script responsibly and only on systems you have explicit permission to test. By understanding and mitigating such vulnerabilities, we contribute to a safer and more resilient cyberspace.
